Sorting refers to the process of arranging a collection of items or elements in a particular order, typically based on some defined criteria

Sorting helps in organizing data, searching for specific elements efficiently, and enabling other algorithms to perform more effectively.There are various sorting algorithms available, each with its own characteristics and performance trade-offs. Some common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort, among others. These algorithms employ different techniques to rearrange the elements and achieve the desired sorted order.

**Bubble Sort**

Idea: In Bubble sort,the larger elements gradually "bubble" or move towards the end of the array.

TC: For bubble sort, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm needs to perform comparisons and swaps for every pair of elements in the array. If we have 'n' elements in the array, the number of comparisons and swaps can be approximated as (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1, which is equal to (n * (n-1)) / 2.
Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2)
